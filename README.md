This repository contains some sample code files including sensor to microprocessor communication,  optimisation & interpretation of the data received from various sensors etc
Since it's a code file of an customized robotic platform, in public files ,there can be some functions  whose source code didn't shared. 
Since it's a robotic platform with color, distance perception, acc & gyro sensor, wifi module, two DC motors, a microprocessor, some rgb leds and IRDA (a infrared sensor used to communicate robots among themselves.), the code files includes informations about these stuffs.
