This repository contains some sample code files including sensor to microprocessor communication,  optimisation & interpretation of the data received from various sensors etc
Since it's a repository of an customized robotic platform, in public files, there can be some functions whose source code didn't shared. 
As it's a robotic platform with color, proxy perception, acc & gyro sensor, wifi module, two DC motors, a microprocessor, some rgb leds and IRDA (a infrared sensor used to communicate robots among themselves.), the code files includes informations about these stuffs.
